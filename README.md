# Movie Popularity Analysis

## Project Overview
We have done a popularity analysis on the conventional and social media movies
released between 2014-2015. We have picked a dataset which contains information
about these movies and studied their popularity.

## Overview
Apply different ML Classification Algorithms on the dataset and derive inferences from
data using Python.

## System Requirements
● Python3 should be installed on the PC.

● Data Science Packages such as matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy etc.

● The code can be run in Spyder IDE for better understanding and results, if installed.

● Some of the statistical data was derived using the Jupyter Notebook.
